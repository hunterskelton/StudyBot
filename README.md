# StudyBot
StudyBot is a python program designed to assist people in studying different subjects via user input.

"StudyBot" is a python-written program designed with the intention of being used by people wishing to study a given subject quickly and easily. The program collects the user's answers via system input and displays responses via system output. The user is prompted by the system to select subjects and categories to study, which they choose via typed input. The system is capable of responding to the user based on whether or not it recognizes their input, and has preset responses for different scenarios. Currently, there are three different subjects implemented which contain various categories, but the simple layout and deisgn of StudyBot.py allows for easy, seamless addition of subjects and categories which automatically are recognized by the system once implemented. When the user is actually studying, the system automatically records their correct and incorrect answers and notifies the user when they go on streaks.
